## Project Description:newspaper:

This is one of the last projects of the System engineering & DevOps in the second quarter about the basics of networking, in this project you going to see learn about netstat, ping, OSI, LAN, WAN and a lot of content.

---

## General Objectives:bulb:
What you should learn from this project:

### OSI Model

* What it is
* How many layers it has
* How it is organized

### What is a LAN

* Typical usage
* Typical geographical size

### What is a WAN

* Typical usage
* Typical geographical size

### What is the Internet

* What is an IP address
* What are the 2 types of IP address
* What is localhost
* What is a subnet
* Why IPv6 was created

### TCP/UDP

* What are the 2 mainly used data transfer protocols for IP (transfer level on the OSI schema)
* What is the main difference between TCP and UDP
* What is a port
* Memorize SSH, HTTP and HTTPS port numbers
* What tool/protocol is often used to check if a device is connected to a network

---

## Instalation:wrench:

Follow the following instructions to get a copy of the program and run in your local machine.

* Clone the following repository.
```

## Tasks:clipboard:

### [0. OSI model](./0-OSI_model)
* OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) is an abstract model to describe layered communication and computer network design. The idea is to segregate the different parts of what make communication possible.


### [1. Types of network](./1-types_of_network)
* 


### [2. MAC and IP address](./2-MAC_and_IP_address)
* 


### [3. UDP and TCP](./3-UDP_and_TCP)
* 


### [4. TCP and UDP ports](./4-TCP_and_UDP_ports)
* Once packets have been sent to the right network device using IP using either UDP or TCP as a mode of transportation, it needs to actually enter the network device.


### [5. Is the host on the network](./5-is_the_host_on_the_network)
*
