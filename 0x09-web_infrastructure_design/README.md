## Learning Objectives:bulb:
What you should learn from this project:

* You must be able to draw a diagram covering the web stack you built with the sysadmin/devops track projects
* You must be able to explain what each component is doing
* You must be able to explain system redundancy
* Know all the mentioned acronyms: LAMP, SPOF, QPS

### [0. Simple web stack](./0-simple_web_stack)
* A lot of websites are powered by simple web infrastructure, a lot of time it is composed of a single server with a LAMP stack.


### [1. Distributed web infrastructure](./1-distributed_web_infrastructure)
* On a whiteboard, design a three server web infrastructure that hosts the website www.foobar.com.


### [2. Secured and monitored web infrastructure](./2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure)
* On a whiteboard, design a three server web infrastructure that hosts the website www.foobar.com, it must be secured, serve encrypted traffic, and be monitored.


### [3. Scale up](./3-scale_up)
